`vision_transformer.ipynb`: implementation of VisionTransformer from scratch

Original VisionTransformer paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

According to the paper, the full potential of the vision transformer can only be exploited when it is pretrained on a large dataset. In `cifar_10_dataset` and `covid19_and_pneumonia_detection` directories, a pretrained ViT is used for some basic image recogition tasks.
